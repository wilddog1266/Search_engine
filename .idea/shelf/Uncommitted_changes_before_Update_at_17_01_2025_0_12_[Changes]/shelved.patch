+# Search_engine
+My search enigne project was created in order to simplify the search through sections and pages of websites by keywords.
+On the main page of website, we see 3 clickable sections and information about indexed sites.

+In the "management" section, we see the start button, which is also a stop button. We also see a textbox in which you can add a separate link to the page in order to index it again.

+Well, the final section, it is also the most important, the search section, in which a keyword search is already taking place.
